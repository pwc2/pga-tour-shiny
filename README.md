# Exploring PGA Tour Data with Shiny

This app is an exploratory tool that allows the user to select a particular year (or view all years at once) and which statistics they would like to plot. They can also select the range of golfers that they want to look at, based on their final [Official World Golf Ranking](http://www.owgr.com/) for the season. 

Plots are interactive, thanks to [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/). When hovering over a point with the cursor, the user will see the values for the variables that are plotted, as well as the golfer's name and their final Official World Golf Ranking for the season. Points are color coded based on the golfer's final Official World Golf Ranking (Final OWGR) as well.
